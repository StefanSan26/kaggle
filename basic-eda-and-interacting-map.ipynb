Among his victims were five dead coworkers and five injured police officers. Martin had a felony record and lengthy history of domestic violence; he was able to obtain a gun despite having had his Illinois firearms ownership identification card revoked. According to a report from prosecutors, Martin told a co-worker the morning of the shooting that if he was fired he was going to kill employees and police.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Location:&lt;/strong&gt; Aurora, Illinois&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Case:&lt;/strong&gt; Harry Pratt Co. warehouse shooting&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total Victims:&lt;/strong&gt; 11&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Year:&lt;/strong&gt; 2019&lt;/div&gt;`)[0];\n","                popup_ecfd3026ed67626bbd6ac3c9fe2c9575.setContent(html_d92ea5543225072ec64f396d0eacb958);\n","            \n","        \n","\n","        marker_46e7566c0616914a8ebb870d2e48e5be.bindPopup(popup_ecfd3026ed67626bbd6ac3c9fe2c9575)\n","        ;\n","\n","        \n","    \n","    \n","            var marker_5cbdd90e96b95c154459f8e25be0901a = L.marker(\n","                [40.785142, -77.839411],\n","                {}\n","            ).addTo(map_c655eec37105674262acbff53d5b90dd);\n","        \n","    \n","        var popup_020a41867edcf569b196523dd3f700e7 = L.popup({&quot;maxWidth&quot;: 400});\n","\n","        \n","            \n","                var html_9ed335cfba0a25d77d9a9984cc7ae95f = $(`&lt;div id=&quot;html_9ed335cfba0a25d77d9a9984cc7ae95f&quot; style=&quot;width: 100.0%; height: 100.0%;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary:&lt;/strong&gt; Jordan Witmer, 21, shot three people at a Ramada Hotel bar near Penn State University, including a former girlfriend he was there with.

Xaver, 21, fatally shot five women inside a bank and then called the police to confess. He was armed with a handgun and wore a bulletproof vest. He reportedly ordered the women to lie down on the floor and shot them execution-style. After a standoff with police, he surrendered and was taken into custody. A week prior, Xaver had quit a job as a prison guard trainee, and authorities said they believed the shooting was &quot;a random act&quot; and that roberry did not appear to be a motive. An ex-girlfriend in Indiana told local media she&#x27;d been “scared for years” by Xaver’s talk of violence and death, but that her warnings to others (who she did not identify) were not taken seriously. She said she’d first met Xaver in a psychiatric hospital in 2013. In March 2017, Michigan State Police documented an incident in which Xaver indicated he was “possibly thinking of suicide by cop and taking hostages.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Location:&lt;/strong&gt; Sebring, Florida&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Case:&lt;/strong&gt; SunTrust bank shooting&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total Victims:&lt;/strong&gt; 5&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Year:&lt;/strong&gt; 2019&lt;/div&gt;`)[0];\n","                popup_c0a0750ee19db8201fa78d9a7ccd1378.setContent(html_a8364a6a8f8f3794717845f665aa4cad);\n","            \n","        \n","\n","        marker_04b460230b0089d1ead703a2547b626f.bindPopup(popup_c0a0750ee19db8201fa78d9a7ccd1378)\n","        ;\n","\n","        \n","    \n","    \n","            var marker_1e86e288103aa3044e58327dd57e8a14 = L.marker(\n","                [41.847667, -87.622009],\n","                {}\n","            ).addTo(map_c655eec37105674262acbff53d5b90dd);\n","        \n","    \n","        var popup_078e96250fb0f07875563bdc3571e151 = L.popup({&quot;maxWidth&quot;: 400});\n","\n","        \n","            \n","                var html_08348d52d5058c0209d949040630b0f2 = $(`&lt;div id=&quot;html_08348d52d5058c0209d949040630b0f2&quot; style=&quot;width: 100.0%; height: 100.0%;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary:&lt;/strong&gt; Juan Lopez, 32, confronted his former fiancé, ER doctor Tamara O&#x27;Neal, before shooting her and opening fire on others at the hospital, including a responding police officer, Samuel Jimenez, and a pharmacy employee, Dayna Less.
